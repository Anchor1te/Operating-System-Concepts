Here are the steps to add a user named "student" to Kali Linux:

    Log in as root:

sudo su

    Add a user named "student" to the system:

useradd student

    Set a password for the "student" user:

passwd student

You will be prompted to enter the new password and then re-enter it to confirm it.

    Verify that the user was added:

cat /etc/passwd

This will display a list of all users on the system, including the newly added "student" user.

    Log in as the "student" user:

su student

You will be prompted to enter the password for the "student" user.

    Verify that you are logged in as the "student" user:


whoami

This should return "student".

    Log out as the "student" user:
exit
Now, you have added a new user named "student" to the system, logged in as that user, and verified that you were logged in as the correct user.
